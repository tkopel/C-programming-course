/*Midterm Programmin Assignment Problem 2
September 15 COS 116 OL 011


Write a loop using a sentinel value. 
The sentinel value will be "999" and when this number is entered, the loop will end. 
The user will enter a number. You will examine the number and determine if it is even or odd. 
If it is even, you will add one to the even counter. If it is odd, add one to the odd counter.
When the loop has ended, print out a message telling how many even and odd numbers were entered.*/

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
      
      /*message to deliver the purpose of the program to the user*/
	  printf("This program will determine whether a user entered integer is even or odd.");
	  printf("\nIt will keep a tally of odd numbers and even numbers entered.");
	  printf("\nTo display the total tally of odd and even numbers, please enter 999.");
	  
	  /*defines sentry to be 999, also created integer variables for number entry and even odd number counting*/
	  #define CUTOFF 999 
	  int num;
      int evenCounter, oddCounter;

      printf("\n\nEnter an integer you want to check. To quit enter 999: ");
