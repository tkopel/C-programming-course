/*Midterm Programming Assignment 3*/
/*September 15 COS 116 OL 011*/

/*Write a program that contains the function measure() that is to accept a long 
integer number total and the addresses of the integer variables inches, feet, yards, and miles. 
The passed long integer represents the total number of inches, and the function is to determine 
the number of miles, yards, feet, and inches in the passed value, writing these values directly 
into the respective variables declared in the calling function.

This function will be called from the main program and when it returns to main, 
it will print out the values of inches, feet, yards, and miles.*/
