/*Written assignment 1
Part B question 1

This program will allow you to enter 2 variables, named save1 and save2, and add them together to get a total and also calculate their average.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int save1; /*creating a variable named save2 that will store an integer*/
	int save2; /*creating a variable named save2 that will store an integer*/
	int total; /*creating a variable named total that will store the sum of save1 and save2*/
	int average; /*creating a variable named average that will store the average of the sum of save1 and save2*/

	save1 = 5; /*inputs 5 for the value of save1*/
	save2 = 2; /*inputs 2 for the value of save2*/
	total = save1 + save2; /*tells the computer to add save1 and save2 together and input the value into total*/
	average = total / 2.0; /*tells the computer to divide the value known as total by 2 and input the value into average*/
	printf("The total sum of save1 and save2 is %d\n", total); /*this will display the number stored as total*/
	printf("The average of save1 and save2 is %d\n", average); /*this will display the number stored as average*/
