/*Midterm Programming Assignment Problem 1
September 15 COS 116 OL 011


This program requires the user to enter two floating-point numbers (num1 and num2) from the keyboard. 
The program will multiply them and display the original two numbers and the calculated floating-point product. 
The product will be limited to a display of 3 digits after the decimal.*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	/* creates floating point variable named num1, num2, and product*/
	float num1, num2, product; 
    /*informative message for the user about the program*/
	printf("This program will take two user entered numbers and multiply them together.\n");
	/*prompts user entry*/
	printf("\nPlease enter your first number: ");
	scanf("%f",&num1); /*allows entry of floating num1 variable*/
	printf("\nPlease enter your second number: ");
	scanf("%f",&num2);/*allows entry of floating num2 variable*/
	
	product = num1 * num2; /*creates arithmatic for floating variable product*/

    /*displays two user entered numbers and product of their multiplication to 3 decimal places.*/	
	printf("The product of %f and %f is %.3f", num1, num2, product); 
	
	return 0;
